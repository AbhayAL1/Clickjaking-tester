# Clickjacking Tester

This project is a simple web-based tool for testing web pages for clickjacking vulnerabilities. It allows users to embed a URL inside an iframe to check if the target page permits iframe embedding, which can indicate a potential clickjacking issue.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive design for easy testing.
- **Iframe Embedding**: Dynamically loads the provided URL in an iframe.
- **Quick Testing**: Instantly verify if a page can be framed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Clickjacking-tester.git
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` File**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

3. **Enter a URL to Test**:
   - Input the desired URL into the text box.
   - Click the "Test it!" button.

4. **Analyze the Results**:
   - If the iframe displays the target page, the page might be vulnerable to clickjacking.
   - If the iframe remains blank or displays an error, the page likely has protections in place (e.g., X-Frame-Options or Content Security Policy).

## Important Notes

- **Security Headers**: Modern websites often use `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers to prevent clickjacking. This tool helps identify whether such protections are implemented.
- **Ethical Use**: Use this tool responsibly and only on web pages you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized testing may violate legal or ethical guidelines.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for URL embedding and iframe management.

## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to detect and display specific security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options).
- Provide detailed information about how to mitigate clickjacking vulnerabilities.
- Support for advanced security testing features.
